# Developing ASP.NET Web Apps
In this course students will learn to use .NET Framework tools and technologies to develop advanced ASP.NET MVC applications. The focus will be on coding activities that improve performance and scalability of Web site applications. ASP.NET MVC will be introduced and compared with Web Forms so that students know when each should/could be used. This course will help prepare students for exam 70-486.

## Which version of Visual Studio should you get?
You'll need a working version of Visual Studio.  You can download it for free.   The primary focus is on Web development using ASP.NET framework, so it is important that you must already know the fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  Visit the link below to dowload and install a version on your system.  It is recommended that you install the latest version.  Visual Studio comes in three flavors:  `Community`, `Professional`, `Enterprise`.

The `Community edition` is preferred for use in the Web program (we love free and open source stuff), since it is free and is nearly identical to the Professional version. The `Professional` and `Enterprise` versions require a license key, which you can grab from Azure after you find the software, as described below.

This version only requires a Microsoft Account of any type to activate and use (and is therefore recommended). You can also download the trial versions of Professional and Enterprise through this site as well. If you want to unlock the products, you will need a license key, which you can get from Microsoft's Azure Platform for free (keep reading).

### PC Users
Visual Studio Downloads:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/

All three versions can be downloaded through Microsoft's Azure Platform at https://aka.ms/devtoolsforteaching (you must register with your student email to create an account). Each semester, students registered in IT courses are added to a list of approved accounts which will give you access to the Azure platform.  (Be careful as you navigate this platform. Some items in here can be very expensive to use, namely any of the Azure-based tools, OSs, and software. We want the free stuff -- keep reading.)

Once you are logged into Azure with your student account, use the search box at the top of the window, and search for " education".  The Education section of the site, may be marked "preview", which is what you want. Once in the Education Area, you will see a listing for " software" in the left side bar menu of that section, click it. Once the software list populates on screen, you can then search for what you need, which is "Visual Studio". Many versions are listed. For this course, any version of 2017 or 2019 are preferred.  Once you find the software you need, click it. A right-side window will appear where you can get your license key and download the product. Keep a copy of the license key for your records in case you need to re-install in the future.

### MAC Users
Mac versions of Visual Studio are also available, however, we have discovered that the required project templates do not yet exist for this platform to do the work in this class. That may change in the future, but for now, VS is still fairly new for the Mac, but who knows what the future will hold. If you are using a Mac, consider installing Windows as a VM (Virtual Machine), dual boot to Windows, or use the Docker container.
